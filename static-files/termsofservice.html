            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Last updated: June 23, 2021.</p>
            <p>The following section has been written by a person whose native language is not English, so if you have any questions, please send an email to admin@rs1.es.</p>
            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p>These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("the user") and us, concerning the access and use of this Site.</p>
            <p>We are the owners of all the source code and trademarks of this Site.</p>
            <p>This page offers several free tools for developers or anyone who finds them useful. The tools are not intended for production use and therefore are offered with no guarantee at all.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to update these terms at any time and for any reason.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to cancel the service and, consequently, delete all user files at any time (with a prior notice on the website).</p>
            <p><b>Location and owner of the underlying infraestructure</b></p>
            <p>Tools are hosted in Ireland (storage tool uses a CDN). All services are hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS), so we are not the owners of the servers and we don't have direct access to them.</p>
            <p><b>Intellectual property of user files</b></p>
            <p>We respect the ownership and copyright of the user's files and we will not share them for any reason.</p>
            <p><b>Abusive use</b></p>
            <p id="tos-limits">We will consider to be an abusive use of the tools if any of these things happen: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Crypto-mining.</li>
                    <li>Any type of DDoS attack.</li>
                    <li>An excessive use of CPU resources.</li>
                    <li>Network-intensive tasks.</li>
                    <li>The user uploads a file with sexual content, violence, racial intolerance or any content that justifies hate against other people or breaks any law.</li>
                    <li>The user uses this Site to do any illegal activity.</li>
                </ul>We will delete any file or VPS that does not meet the previous requirements.</p>
